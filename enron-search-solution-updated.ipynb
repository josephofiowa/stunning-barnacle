    "# Solution Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The task asks the program to find emails that match a given string the user passes. The solution should not read all data into memory and should seek to be as efficient as possible in the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution has two key portions: parsing and indexing all Enron emails by sender, recipient, and unique words per email. This pre-processing will then be applied to all emails in the corpus such that all emails are indexed. The second portion -- the true search function -- then allows a user to search a given word across all email metadata (unique words, sender, and recipient).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to preprocessing time constraints, this solution only works for a single Enron employee (allen-p), but the code is applicable to any employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, this notebook contains **both** portions of the above stated solution (pre-processing and the actual search function). Because of this, the preprocessed text is still unnecessarily in-memory. In a deployed environment, the search function would be separately exported as a Python script, and it would be called in order to search through metadata that are static files. This is clearly denoted in the below comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, a to-do solution portion is noted: this search function has yet to recieve powerful optimization. It loops through all emails. A next step is narrowing search scope down to the email_sender or email_recipient (if the lawyers know this information). In addition, the metadata files should be indexed themselves as trees.\n",

      "which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \n",
      "the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \n",
      "there can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \n",
      "generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn't schedule their \n",
      "generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \n",
      "will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \n",
      "munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \n",
      "if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \n",
      "schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \n",
      "all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \n",
      "the generation side.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \n",

      "I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in \n",
      "the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \n",
      "March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \n",
      "over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \n",
      "temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \n",
      "into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \n",
      "compared with the previous year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \n",
      "reductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \n",
      "forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \n",
      "total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \n",
      "This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \n",
      "more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \n",
      "decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \n",
      "retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \n",
      "is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \n",
      "year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \n",
      "Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \n",
      "are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \n",
      "meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \n",
      "economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \n",
      "make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \n",
      "only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \n",
      "(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \n",
      "portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \n",
      "demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \n",
      "you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \n",
      "smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \n",
      "least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \n",
      "wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \n",
      "mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \n",
      "sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \n",
      "how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \n",
      "Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's \n",
      "economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \n",
      "the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \n",
      "think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \n",
      "realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \n",
      "non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \n",
      "WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \n",

      "As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and \n",
      "existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, \n",
      "and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which \n",
      "current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this \n",
      "project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design \n",
      "and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of \n",
      "our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or \n",
      "rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is \n",
      "facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the \n",
      "previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \n",
      "well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of \n",

      "pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \n",
      "thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile \n",
      "to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by \n",
      "customers. \n",
      "\n",
      "But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand \n",
      "cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage \n",
      "for winter. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, \n",
      "prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information \n",
      "Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating \n",
      "bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. \n",
      "\n",
      "But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, \n",
      "including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas \n",
      "markets. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York \n",
      "traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile \n",
      "commodity in the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting the price \n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of \n",
      "gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading \n",
      "contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had \n",
      "widespread influence over gas prices. \n",
      "\n",
      "The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon \n",
      "as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale \n",
      "prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from \n",
      "utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what \n",
      "they pay for the gas they expect to use. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention \n",
      "of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge \n",
      "of natural gas. \n",
      "\n",
      "But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to \n",
      "know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all \n",
      "futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to \n",
      "their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money \n",
      "in a short time. \n",
      "\n",
      "As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less \n",
      "than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. \n",
      "Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's \n",
      "weekly storage numbers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to \n",
      "need in the winter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than \n",
      "average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in \n",
      "hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be \n",
      "sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the \n",
      "concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage \n",
      "numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the \n",
      "association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \n",
      "\n",
      "But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice \n",
      "president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had \n",
      "continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was getting worried,\" he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. \n",
      "Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \n",
      "dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just passing through \n",
      "\n",
      "Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but \n",
      "pass their fuel costs on to customers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas \n",
      "charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas \n",
      "Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last \n",
      "month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could \n",
      "be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve \n",
      "energy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to \n",
      "save an average customer about $25 this winter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an \n",
      "extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not \n",
      "guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left \n",
      "customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether \n",
      "they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel \n",
      "costs. \n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public \n",
      "Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to \n",
      "perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. \n",

      "previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \n",
      "thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile \n",
      "to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by \n",
      "customers. \n",
      "\n",
      "But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand \n",
      "cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage \n",
      "for winter. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, \n",
      "prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information \n",
      "Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating \n",
      "bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. \n",
      "\n",
      "But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, \n",
      "including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas \n",
      "markets. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York \n",
      "traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile \n",
      "commodity in the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting the price \n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of \n",
      "gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading \n",
      "contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had \n",
      "widespread influence over gas prices. \n",
      "\n",
      "The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon \n",
      "as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale \n",
      "prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from \n",
      "utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what \n",
      "they pay for the gas they expect to use. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention \n",
      "of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge \n",
      "of natural gas. \n",
      "\n",
      "But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to \n",
      "know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all \n",
      "futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to \n",
      "their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money \n",
      "in a short time. \n",
      "\n",
      "As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less \n",
      "than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. \n",
      "Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's \n",
      "weekly storage numbers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to \n",
      "need in the winter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than \n",
      "average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in \n",
      "hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be \n",
      "sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the \n",
      "concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage \n",
      "numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the \n",
      "association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \n",
      "\n",
      "But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice \n",
      "president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had \n",
      "continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was getting worried,\" he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. \n",
      "Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \n",
      "dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just passing through \n",
      "\n",
      "Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but \n",
      "pass their fuel costs on to customers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas \n",
      "charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas \n",
      "Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last \n",
      "month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could \n",
      "be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve \n",
      "energy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to \n",
      "save an average customer about $25 this winter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an \n",
      "extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not \n",
      "guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left \n",
      "customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether \n",
      "they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel \n",
      "costs. \n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public \n",
      "Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to \n",
      "perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. \n",

      "\n",
      "We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, \n",
      "the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. \n",
      "spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his \n",
      "ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next \n",
      "week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  \n",
      "Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on \n",
      "my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff \n",
      "Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our \n",
      "proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \n",
      "based on the governor's comments:\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that \n",
      "we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \n",
      "communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \n",
      "go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \n",
      "the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \n",
      "work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \n",
      "talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \n",
      "level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \n",
      "benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \n",
      "would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \n",
      "(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \n",
      "solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \n",
      "the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.\n",
      "Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \n",
      "included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \n",
      "interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \n",
      "goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \n",
      "to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \n",
      "analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \n",
      "including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \n",
      "He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \n",
      "purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \n",
      "some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\n",
      "His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \n",
      "under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \n",
      "Some of these ideas would require legislative action.\n",
      "State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \n",

      "spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his \n",

      "we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \n",

      "talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \n",

      "benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \n",
      "would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \n",
      "(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \n",
      "solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \n",
      "the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.\n",
      "Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \n",

      "interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \n",
      "goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \n",
      "to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \n",
      "analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \n",
      "including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \n",

      "Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\n",

      "LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\n",
      "The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\n",
      "any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\n",
      "the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\n",
      "all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\n",
      "loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\n",
      "that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\n",
      "is reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\n",
      "full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\n",
      "the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\n",
      "non-recourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\n",
      "The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\n",
      "architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\n",
      "organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\n",

      "Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\n",
      "the estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n",
      "\n",
      "EARLY LAND COSTS\n",
      "The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\n",
      "represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\n",
      "extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\n",
      "probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\n",
      "price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\n",

      "spent no interest is charged on these funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\n",
      "finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\n",
      "high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\n",

      "$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\n",

      "Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\n",
      "near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\n",
      "payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\n",
      "will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\n",

      "cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\n",
      "function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\n",
      "from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\n",
      "Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\n",
      "used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\n",
      "any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\n",
      "to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n",
